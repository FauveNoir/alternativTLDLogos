Alternative logos for Top Level Names in Creative Commons

#History
The first time I had the idea of redesign a TLD logo, it was for my website with `.info`. I firstly search the `.info` official logo to interate it on my website logo but I find an ugly 80’s design. Someting witch we can’t be proud about it. I made a nice logo with prety typography for the second lever part of my domain name but the top level official logo break all my work. That’s why I redesign it.
